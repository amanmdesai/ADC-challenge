# ADC-challenge
My code for the ADC challenge



## Description


Until 23 September i have pre-processed the data and included -9 when there is absence of the particle. In addition I have also included three additional variables the number of electrons, muons and jets. However it is not clear if these additions will be okay as such. The results of the previous studies until then are stored in the `more-variable-experiment` folder.

Some untracked results are also reported in results/old folder. Default results present the comparison between the ground example and the dataset.
